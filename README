Lots of little mods to drewhavard/rasp-sous-vide.
ToDo:
 - Ensure Setup runs properly/flawlessly every time.
 - Check config file to ensure 1-wire is setup properly
 - Split daemon into 2 parts to easily drop in other temp measurement methods
 - auto-start daemon on system run/reboot (setup.sh should do this!)
 - set a timer on the get_temp daemon to measure once/sec or less
 - regular backup of graph items and rrd db to non-volitile storage

Done:
 - Moved graphing items and db to tmpfs to avoid burning our SD-card
 - Gutted some of the web-page / replaced missing info with anhanced graphs
 - setup.sh file to copy files and set initial configs... may also update and isntall deps if uncommented.
